  The SCD30 measures CO2 with accuracy of +/- 30ppm.

  This library handles the initialization of the SCD30 and outputs
  CO2 levels, relative humidty, and temperature.

  Arduino IDE 1.8.5

  **********************************************************************
  modified by paulvh version 10 August, 2018

  Changes:
  * Added ESP8266 board detection in begin() to support the ESP8266 clockstretching
  * Added settting and display debugging
  * Added obtaining serial number of SCD-30
  * Added StopMeasurement
  * Added StartSingleMeasurement
  * Added CRC checks on different places
  * Added getTemperatureF (Fahrenheit)

  Modified by Paulvha version February 2019

 Changes:
 * Added option in examples 10 and 13 to set BME280 I2C address. (some use 0x76 instead of 0x77)
 * Added SoftWire (a port of the ESP8266 I2C library) for ESP32 (which does NOT support clockstretching)
 * Removed StartSingleMeasurement as that is not working in the SCD30 as it should.
 * Added option to begin() to disable starting measurement. (needed in case one wants to read serial number)
 * updated the keywords.txt file
 * updated sketches and library where needed
 *
  Modified by Paulvha version August 2020

 changes based on Datasheet May 2020
 * added functions : getForceRecalibration, getMeasurementInterval, getTemperatureOffset, getAltitudeCompensation, getFirmwareLevel
 * updated the keywords.txt file
 * added example14 to demonstrate the new functions
 * updated sketches and library where needed
 *
 Change October 2020
  * Update in readmeasurement to translate byte to float. did not work on Arduino. Tested on Uno, Artemis Apollo3, ESP32
  * Added example5 to work with Sparkfun LCD
  * update to example4
  *
 Change November 2020
  * solved a conflict with ByteToFloat when using SPS30 at the same time (rename to ByteToFl)
