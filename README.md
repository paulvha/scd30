# paulvha SCD30 library
===========================================================

An extended SCD30 library based on the SparkFun SCD30 CO2 Sensor Library, see information below

## Versioning

### Change July 2022
  * added option autoCalibrate to begin() to enable disable auto calibration (contribution of jhengstermann)
  * begin(TwoWire &wirePort = Wire, bool m_begin = true, boolean autoCalibrate = true);
  * wirePort : I2C channel to use.  Wire by default.
  * m_begin  : if true will start measurement every 2 seconds. True / start by default.
  * autoCalibrate : if true will enable or false disable autocalibrate at begin. True / Enable ASC by default.

### Modified by Paulvha version November 2020
  * solved a conflict with ByteToFloat when using SPS30 at the same time

### Modified by Paulvha version October 2020
  * Update in readmeasurement to translate byte to float. It did not work on Arduino. Tested on Uno, Artemis Apollo3, ESP32
  * added example4 to manual input temperature offset and see impact.
  * SECOND UPDATE IN OCTOBER
  * Added example5 to work with Sparkfun LCD
  * update to example4 to set and calibrate temperature offset

### Modified by Paulvha version August 2020:

 Changes based on Datasheet May 2020
 * added functions : getForceRecalibration, getMeasurementInterval, getTemperatureOffset, getAltitudeCompensation, getFirmwareLevel
 * updated the keywords.txt file
 * added example14 to demonstrate the new functions
 * A number of library enhancements
 * updated sketches and library where needed

### Modified by Paulvha version February 2019

 Changes:
 * Added option in examples 10 and 13 to set BME280 I2C address. (some use 0x76 instead of 0x77)
 * Added SoftWire (a port of the ESP8266 I2C library) for ESP32 (which does NOT support clockstretching)
 * Removed StartSingleMeasurement as that is not working in the SCD30 as it should.
 * Added option to begin() to disable starting measurement. (needed in case one wants to read serial number)
 * updated the keywords.txt file
 * updated sketches and library where needed

### Modified by paulvha version 10 August, 2018

  Changes:
  * Added ESP8266 board detection in begin() to support the ESP8266 clockstretching
  * Added setting debug messages
  * Added obtaining serial number of SCD30
  * Added StopMeasurement
  * Added StartSingleMeasurement (removed February 2019 as it IS unstable)
  * Added GetTemperature in Fahrenheit
  * Added CRC checks on different places in de driver
  * Updated existing sketches fom Sparkfun to new library
  * Added new sketches :
            Example 10: combined read with BME280
            Example 11: Set ESP8266 as Access Point and read SCD30 in browser
            Example 12: Set ESP8266 as WIFI server and read SCD30 in browser

More work to be follow on connecting / comparing with other sensors and document the learnings.

SparkFun SCD30 CO2 Sensor Library

[*SparkX CO₂ Humidity and Temperature Sensor - SCD30 (SPX-14751)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14751)

The SCD30 from Sensirion is a high quality [NDIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondispersive_infrared_sensor) based CO₂ sensor capable of detecting 400 to 10000ppm with an accuracy of ±(30ppm+3%). In order to improve accuracy the SCD30 has temperature and humidity sensing built-in, as well as commands to set the current altitude.

We've written an Arduino library to make reading the CO₂, humidity, and temperature very easy. It can be downloaded through the Arduino Library manager: search for 'SparkFun SCD30'. We recommend using a [Qwiic Breadboard Cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425) to connect the SCD30 to a Qwiic compatible board. The Ye*LL*ow wire goes in the SC*L* pin. The SCD30 also supports a serial interface but we haven't worked with it.

The CO₂ sensor works very well and for additional accuracy the SCD30 accepts ambient pressure readings. We recommend using the SCD30 in conjunction with the [Qwiic Pressure Sensor - MS5637](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14688) or the [Qwiic Environmental Sensor - BME680](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14570) to obtain the current barometric pressure.

Note: The SCD30 has an automatic self-calibration routine. Sensirion recommends 7 days of continuous readings with at least 1 hour a day of 'fresh air' for self-calibration to complete.
